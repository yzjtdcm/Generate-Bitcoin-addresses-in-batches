# btcaddress

This program can generate bitcoin addresses, private keys, and public keys starting with 1 in batches. Run setup.bat to install the library, run run.bat to run the program, and the generated address is saved in address.txt.

Who can modify a program so that it can generate addresses starting with 3 and bc1?
